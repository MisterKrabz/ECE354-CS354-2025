Linux Operating System (OS)
Basic commands
        man, ls, cat, echo
        ssh, scp

Andrew File System (AFS) commands to manage your Linux networked file space

    file path, filename, absolute vs. relative
    cd, mkdir, rmdir, mv, rm, cp vs. scp

Executable Object Files (EOF)
    build executable file (from C source to EOF): pre-process, compile, assemble, link
    execute (run the program): load (EOF), execute machine code
    Linux tools: vim, gcc, gdb

C Programming
Libraries
    stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h, 

Standard functions
    printf, scanf
    strcpy, strcat, strlen, strncpy
    fopen, fclose, fprintf, fscanf
    Standard IO, String IO, File IO

Variables
    declaring, assigning to, and initializing variables
    32 bit types: char, int, double, and pointers
    compatible types
    casting from one type to a compatible type

Defining functions
    naming, parameter list, and return type
    returning values

Pointers, Arrays, and Structs

    Stack allocated array structure for 1D, 2D, and more dimensions
    address arithmetic
    syntax for declaring array variable names

    STACK vs HEAP arrays
        Stack: 
        - created when function is called and destroyed when function exits 
        - size must be known at compile time
        - sizeof() operator: returns total array size in bytes 

        Heap: 
        - created with malloc(), destroyed with free()
        - size can be determined at run time 
        - sizeof operator: returns size of the pointer not size of the array 

    accessing elements of 1D and multi-dimensional arrays on STACK and HEAP
    modifying elements of 1D and multi-dimensional arrays on STACK and HEAP

        int stackArray[10];
        int *heapArray = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));

        // ALL of the following are valid and do the same thing:
        stackArray[3] = 10;
        *(stackArray + 3) = 10;

        heapArray[3] = 20;
        *(heapArray + 3) = 20;

    storing and passing along the size of each array
    passing structs to functions (struct copy vs. pointers to structs)
    nesting in structs and arrays of structs

    Order of Operations C
    () [] ->                (grouping, struct)
    .                       (member access)
    ! -- ++ * sizeof()      (unary operators)
    * / % + -               (arithmetic)
    < <= > >=               (comparisons)
    == !=                   (comparisons)
    || &&                   (logical operators)
    = += -= *= /=           (assignment)
